### Context

In this project we need to design p-Xylene production plant. One requirement is using membrane gas separator to separate p-Xylene from m-Xylene and o-Xylene. The idea will be design the reactor, decanter by ASPEN PLUS while the membrane is modeled in MATLAB. Then we use Component Object Model to link ASPEN PLUS and MATLAB together.
