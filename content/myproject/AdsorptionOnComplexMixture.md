### Introduction
In the petroleum industry, a technique known as lumping has been extensively employed to handle complex mixtures during distillation. In this approach, the mixture is divided into groups of components with similar boiling points, referred to as pseudo-components. The thermodynamic properties of these pseudo-components are typically estimated using correlations derived from extensive studies on the properties of pure hydrocarbons. However, unlike distillation, the thermodynamics of adsorption have not been as thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this section introduces research efforts aimed at adapting the lumping concept from distillation to adsorption. It begins with an overview of sorption analysis techniques used to characterize complex mixtures, analogous to the D86 measurement in distillation, followed by a discussion of several lumping approaches, ranging from simple to advanced models.
