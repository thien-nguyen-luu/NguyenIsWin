    description: This study compared the effects of two types of gasification agents, air and an air-steam mixture, on syngas composition and cumulative CO. The best steam ratio for the best syngas quality was then determined. The two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was created to determine the best kinetics model. Geometric parameters were taken from a practical pilot plant gasifier. This simulation was validated by comparing simulation data to experimental data measured by an online gas analyser-TESTO 350XL. The results show that the air-steam mixture has an effect on the composition of CO and H2 in syngas, the H2/CO ratio, and the benefit of using the stream in gasification on both experimental and simulation results.

# Bio

A self-motivated researcher with hands-on experience in multidisciplinary principles within the boundaries of chemical engineering. Experienced in both experimental research for adsorption and modeling/simulation of separation processes (absorption, adsorption, membranes). I am interested in both mechanistic and statistical modeling, with a particular focus on integrating multiple tools to solve complex problems.
