    description: Pyrolysis can convert mixed plastic waste into oil, but heteroatom impurities limit its direct use in steam crackers. This work assessed activated carbon adsorption as a purification method by testing nine key impurities. Benzoic acid showed the highest adsorption capacity, while less polar compounds were difficult to remove. Multicomponent experiments revealed cooperative adsorption for pyridine and competitive behavior for most others. Models that included interactions between impurities described the system more accurately than those without such interactions.

    description: This study investigated how two gasification agents, pure air and an air steam mixture, influence syngas composition and cumulative carbon monoxide. The optimal steam ratio for producing high quality syngas was identified. A two dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics model was developed to evaluate suitable kinetic models, using geometric parameters taken from a pilot scale gasifier. The simulation was validated against experimental data obtained from an online gas analyser TESTO 350XL. The findings show that adding steam significantly affects the concentrations of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio, and overall gasification performance in both experiments and simulations.

# Bio

A self-motivated researcher with hands-on experience in multidisciplinary principles within the boundaries of chemical engineering. Experienced in both experimental research for adsorption and modeling/simulation of separation processes (absorption, adsorption, membranes). I am interested in both mechanistic and statistical modeling, with a particular focus on integrating multiple tools to solve complex problems.
