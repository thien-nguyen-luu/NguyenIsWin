  description: This study compared the effects of two types of gasification agents, air and an air-steam mixture, on the composition of syngas and cumulative CO. The best steam-to-syngas ratio was then determined. The two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed to determine the best kinetics model. Geometric parameters were derived from a practical pilot gasifier. The validation process for this simulation was carried out by comparing simulation data with experimental data measured by an online gas analyser-TESTO 350XL. The results show the effect of air-steam mixture on the composition of CO and H2 in syngas, the H2/CO ratio, and the benefit of using the stream in gasification on both experimental and simulation results.
